            <h3>Local Hidden Variables, Trichotomy, and Double Negation</h3>
            <p>The proof by contradiction of Local Hidden Variable theory uses the law of trichotomy to reach not-not LHVs. The law of trichotomy does not hold in the BHK framework. Furthermore, not-not P does not necessarily equal P. Thus the specific proof fails in our BHK framework. </p>
              <h3>Undecidability of Reals and the Continuum in Physical Reality</h3>
              <p>Our reals are undecidable. We can prove this by constructing a piecewise cauchy sequence that halts given a flip in the truth value of an unresolved proposition P(n) for n in the naturals. And of course, our numbers are the equivelance classes of cauchy sequences, so our
                numbers are undecidable. This coincides with physical measurement: we resolve truth up to a certain resolution, but
              past the point of precision our measurement permits, the truth value is undecidable.</p>

            <p>
                I'm a third year math and physics double major at UGA who does a wide array of research in machine learning, optimization, categorical quantum computing, and recently, categorical AI. I particularly love type theory and category theory.
