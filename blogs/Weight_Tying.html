            <h3>Summary of Weight Tying</h3>
            <p>If we have an input embedding matrix V (the matrix that vectorizes our words) and an output embedding matrix W (the matrix that wordifies our vectors :F), 
then if we set V = W, this is known as weight tying. Weight tying reduces the number of parameters we have to use significantly;
 specifically by exactly the number of parameters used in the input matrix (assuming the size of V is the same as W).  </p>
<p>For a less naive and a more erudite explanation, see Press and Wolf 2017 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.05859. </p>
