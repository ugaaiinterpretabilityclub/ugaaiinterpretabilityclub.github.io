        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            We are the Physics, Logic, and AI Directed Reading Group (PLAIDRG) at UGA. 
            Our aim is to provide an ecosystem for studying these topics at UGA collaboratively.
            We investigate topics such AI mathematical frameworks, theoretical physics, and the interconnection between these topics and forms of logic such as category, type, constructive, intuitionistic, and linear theory. We meet once a month to discuss papers from the reading 
            list in a group seminar format.
